# Chatbot
This is a chatbot that can answer questions based on a corpus of document. We have used a document titled "newdocument.pdf" as a custom-knowledge base for feeding information about Mirafra.
Llamaindex and Langchain are used for indexing and preprocessing text data. The final chat completion is done via an api request to openai.
